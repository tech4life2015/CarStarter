Remotely Start Your Car with Particle
This is a pet project my self and a friend have been working on since last year.
A Big thanks to Jerrmy Proffitt and the code he wrote to get the Alexa backend to work seemlessly without any complicated backend work.
Here is the link to his project https://github.com/JeremyProffitt/EchoPhotonBridge.
The project allows a user to use a Particle Electron to remotely start their car from a webpage, IFTTT button, or Amazon Alexa.
